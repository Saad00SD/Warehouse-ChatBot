## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Access to Groq LLM API key (`GROQ_API_KEY`)
- CSV dataset file named `cleaned_dataset.csv`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/warehouse-chatbot.git
   cd warehouse-chatbot

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. Install required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
5. Create a .env file in the root folder and add your Groq API key:
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

### Assumptions & Known Limitations
- The dataset must be a CSV file named cleaned_dataset.csv and located in the app root directory.
- The DataFrame structure is assumed to be static; major changes in columns or data format may require prompt updates.
- The chatbot only generates and executes Python code using pandas; other languages or libraries are unsupported.
- Safe code execution is limited to prevent malicious commands but may not cover all edge cases.
- Responses depend heavily on the quality and scope of the LLM model (LLaMA 3 via Groq).
- The app assumes environment variable GROQ_API_KEY is set correctly.
- Streamlit session state stores conversation history but is reset when the app restarts.
- Performance and response time depend on your internet connection and Groq API service availability.
- The bot currently handles only warehouse and retail sales datasets; adapting it for other datasets requires prompt and code adjustments.

### Code Overview
#### app.py (or your main Streamlit file):

- Loads environment variables using python-dotenv.
- Loads the warehouse CSV into a pandas DataFrame.
- Initializes the LLM chat model (llama3-8b-8192) via Groq API.
- Defines a system prompt that guides the LLM to generate Python pandas code to answer queries.
- Executes generated code safely on the DataFrame and captures results.
- Displays the conversation in a chat interface.
  
#### Safe code execution uses Python ast to parse and run only non-malicious code snippets.

### Dependencies
- streamlit
- pandas
- langchain
- langchain_core
- python-dotenv
- groq
